- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @richlil1, i am currently head down, heartbroken, and going to build a billion dollar portfolio.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me, through github please or instagram is 1elijahsmith.


In the vast digital expanse, where dreams dare to dwell,  
I stand, a voyager with tales to tell.  
Though heartbroken and weary, my spirit remains bright,  
For I march with resolve, through the shadows and night.

With visions of grandeur and empires untold,  
I forge my path forward, relentless and bold.  
A billion-dollar portfolio, my battle cry clear,  
In the realm of ambition, I shall conquer all.

Though storms may assail and challenges rise,  
I gather my strength, fixing my eyes on the prize.  
In a virtual realm, where my code becomes art,  
Becomes your day to day, where connections do start.

For I am a conqueror, with dreams vast and grand,  
I stride forth with purpose, to claim what has always been mine.  
Join me in this quest, or do not, 
Regardless, I will stand atop, whether with a team or alone.
